Phil and Owen, the owners of **[Ilkley Dental Care](https://www.ilkleydentalcare.co.uk)**, were exhausted with their old website. Clunky, outdated, and generating no new enquiries, it had become a source of frustration rather than growth. In fact, they were close to scrapping it altogether.  

## The Challenge: A Website That Did More Harm Than Good  

Patients found it difficult to navigate, and enquiries were rare. Worse, their reception staff spent hours answering basic questions over the phone‚Äîtime that could have been spent supporting patients in person.  

Phil and Owen summed it up: *‚ÄúWe were ready to give up on the website altogether.‚Äù*  

## The Solution: A Patient-Centered Redesign  

I worked with them to create a **professional dental website** designed for both patients and the practice team.  

- **Modern, trustworthy design** to reflect their professional care  
- **Clear navigation** so patients could find treatments and information easily  
- **Mobile-friendly layout** to suit patients browsing on their phones  
- **Online enquiry forms** to reduce pressure on the phones  
- **Local SEO optimization** to make sure they appeared in Ilkley searches  

## The Results: More Patients, Less Pressure  

- Over **30 new enquiries per month**  
- Reception team freed up from repetitive calls  
- Renewed confidence that their website was working *for* them, not against them  

## Takeaway
