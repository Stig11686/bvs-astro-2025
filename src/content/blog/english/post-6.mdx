Phil and Owen, the owners of **[Ilkley Dental Care](https://www.ilkleydentalcare.co.uk)**, were exhausted with their old website. Clunky, outdated, and generating no new enquiries, it had become a source of frustration rather than growth. In fact, they were close to scrapping it altogether.

## The Challenge: A Website That Did More Harm Than Good

Patients found it difficult to navigate, and enquiries were rare. Worse, their reception staff spent hours answering basic questions over the phone-time that could have been spent supporting patients in person.

Phil and Owen summed it up: *"We were ready to give up on the website altogether."*

## The Solution: A Patient-Centered Redesign

I worked with them to create a **professional dental website** designed for both patients and the practice team.

- **Modern, trustworthy design** to reflect their professional care
- **Clear navigation** so patients could find treatments and information easily
- **Mobile-friendly layout** to suit patients browsing on their phones
- **Online enquiry forms** to reduce pressure on the phones
- **Local SEO optimization** to make sure they appeared in Ilkley searches

## The Results: More Patients, Less Pressure

- Over **30 new enquiries per month**
- Reception team freed up from repetitive calls
- Renewed confidence that their website was working *for* them, not against them

## Takeaway  

Ilkley Dental Care's story proves that a dental website can be more than just a brochure—it can be a lead generator and time-saver.
