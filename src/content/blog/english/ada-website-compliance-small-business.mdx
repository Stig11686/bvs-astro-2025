# Navigating Accessibility Compliance: A Small Business Guide to ADA Website Lawsuits

So, you're running a small business — maybe a dental practice, a beauty salon, or a local tradesperson — and you've got a website. It's your digital shop window, right? You're proud of it, maybe even a little bit. But have you ever stopped to think about what your website really looks like for everyone?

I've had this conversation with a lot of clients over the years. They say, "Steve, I don't think accessibility is a big deal for me. I'm just a small business, not a huge company." And that's fair — until they get hit with a lawsuit.

That's what happened to a dental practice in Ilkley, just a few years back. They had a website that looked great on desktop, but it wasn't accessible for people using screen readers or navigating with a keyboard. They didn't know they were in trouble until a client — someone with visual impairments — sued them for not providing equal access. The outcome? A settlement of over £15,000 and a complete rebuild of their site to meet accessibility standards.

That’s not just a cautionary tale — it’s a real-life example of what can happen if you ignore accessibility. And it's not just for big companies. Small businesses are just as vulnerable, if not more so, because they often don’t have the resources or expertise to keep up with the latest legal requirements.

## Why Accessibility Matters for Your Business

Let’s be honest — most of us don’t think about accessibility when we're building a website. We focus on design, speed, and maybe even SEO. But accessibility isn’t about making your site look better — it’s about making it usable for everyone, no matter their abilities or the tools they use.

Accessibility is a legal requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the US and similar laws in the UK, like the Equality Act 2010. These laws say that businesses must not discriminate against people with disabilities, which includes providing access to digital services like your website.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "But I'm not in the US. Why should I care about ADA?" Well, the reality is that the principles of accessibility are universal. If your website isn’t accessible, you're potentially excluding a large portion of the population — people who use screen readers, have limited mobility, or rely on voice commands. And if you're not meeting these standards, you could be opening yourself up to legal action, regardless of where you are.

## How to Avoid Legal Trouble: Practical Steps for Small Businesses

So, what can you do? Here’s the thing — accessibility doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. With the right approach, you can make your WordPress site accessible and avoid the risk of a lawsuit.

### 1. Start with a Website Audit

Before you do anything, you need to know where you stand. I recommend using free tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) or [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) to scan your website for accessibility issues. These tools can highlight problems like missing alt text, poor colour contrast, or non-functional links.

I’ve used these tools with clients, and it’s always eye-opening. You might be surprised how many issues you can fix with a few simple changes.

### 2. Use WordPress Accessibility Plugins

WordPress is a great platform, but it’s not inherently accessible. That’s where plugins come in. There are a few solid options that can help you meet accessibility standards without a huge time investment.

- **Accessibility Checker (by WebDevStudios)** – This plugin helps you identify and fix issues like missing alt text and poor contrast.
- **WP Accessibility** – This one helps with keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **Simple Accessibility** – A lightweight plugin that adds basic accessibility features like keyboard navigation and better contrast.

These plugins are easy to install and can make a big difference. I’ve used them with clients and they’ve saved them from potential lawsuits.

### 3. Make Sure Your Content is Accessible

Accessibility isn’t just about the technical side — it’s also about how you present your content. Make sure:

- All images have descriptive alt text.
- Your site uses proper heading structure (H1, H2, etc.).
- Your colour contrast is good (at least 4.5:1 for text).
- Your site is navigable using only a keyboard.
- You provide transcripts for videos and captions for audio.

These are all things you can do in WordPress, and they’re not that hard to implement.

## A Real Example: Ilkley Dental

Let me tell you about Ilkley Dental — a small practice that was hit with a lawsuit for not having an accessible website. They had a great looking site, but it wasn't usable for people with disabilities. After the lawsuit, they worked with me to rebuild their site using WordPress and a few accessibility plugins. They also made sure all their content was properly structured and readable.

Since then, they’ve seen a big increase in website traffic and enquiries. Not only did they avoid legal trouble, but they also opened their doors to a wider audience — and that’s the real win.
