As the owner of Antler Interiors, Sarah knows the frustration of watching potential customers click away from her website without making an enquiry. Since we rebuilt their WordPress site with a focus on accessibility, they've seen a significant boost in online interest, including a 25% increase in website visits and a 30% rise in new leads.

But Sarah's not alone. Many small businesses in the UK are struggling to compete with their ADA-compliant rivals. It's not just about having a nice-looking website – it's about making sure that everyone can use it, regardless of their abilities.

### Your Website Matters for Your Business

Think about it: your website is often the first impression your potential customers have of your business. It's where they go to learn about your products and services, get a sense of your brand, and decide whether or not to take the next step. But what if your website is inaccessible to some of your target audience? What if it takes a few too many clicks to find what they're looking for, or if they get frustrated trying to navigate your menu?

That's exactly what's happening to many small businesses. We've seen it again and again: a business is doing everything right, offering great products and services, but their website is letting them down. They're not ranking as well in search engines as they could be, and they're losing out on potential customers as a result.

### The Impact of Accessibility

So, what's behind this trend towards accessibility? Well, it's largely driven by changes in search engine algorithms. For years, Google has been prioritizing websites that are easy to use and navigate, regardless of whether the user is typing away on a keyboard or tapping on a touch screen. And with more and more people using assistive technologies to browse the web, it's become clear that websites need to be accessible to all.

But it's not just about keeping up with the competition. Accessibility is also about being responsible business owners. By making sure that your website is accessible, you're opening it up to a wider range of customers, including those with disabilities. This isn't just the right thing to do – it's also good business sense.

### Practical Advice for Ada-Compliant Small Business Websites

So, what can you do to make your small business website more accessible? Here are a few practical tips to get you started:

1. **Choose an Accessible Theme**: When it comes to WordPress, there are thousands of themes to choose from. But not all of them are created equal. Look for themes that are specifically designed with accessibility in mind. These themes will be built with features such as high contrast mode, font sizes that can be adjusted, and accessible navigation menus.
2. **Check Your Colour Scheme**: Your colour scheme may look great to you, but it may be hard to read for someone with colour blindness. Use tools such as Snook's colour contrast checker to ensure that your colours are accessible.
3. **Add Alt Text to Images**: If you're using images on your website, make sure that you add alt text to each one. This will help screen readers to describe the image to users who are visually impaired.
4. **Use Headings and Subheadings**: Organising your content with headings and subheadings makes it easier for users to scan and navigate your website.
5. **Test Your Website**: Finally, make sure that you test your website regularly to ensure that it's accessible. You can use tools such as WAVE or Lighthouse to identify areas that need improvement.

### Case Study: Antler Interiors

As I mentioned earlier, we've worked with Antler Interiors to rebuild their WordPress site with a focus on accessibility. The results have been impressive:

* 25% increase in website visits
* 30% rise in new leads
* Improved search engine rankings

But here's the thing: this wasn't just about creating a website that was accessible. It was about creating a website that was easy to use and navigate, regardless of the user's abilities. By prioritising accessibility, Antler Interiors has been able to open up their website to a wider range of customers, including those with disabilities.

### The Takeaway

As a small business owner, it's tempting to focus solely on the bottom line. But the truth is, building an accessible website is good business sense. It's about being responsible, being inclusive, and being competitive. So, what can you do to make your small business website more accessible? It's time to take the first step.
