---

You know your salon needs a website. Every client you speak to found you through Google, or checked out your Instagram before booking. But when you start looking at prices, it's all over the place.

One web designer quotes £500. Another says £3,000. Someone on Facebook swears you can do it yourself for free. And your mate's cousin built theirs for "a few hundred quid" but it looks like it's from 2010.

So what does a beauty salon website *actually* cost in 2026? And more importantly - what should you be paying for?

## The Short Answer

A professional beauty salon website typically costs between **£500 and £3,500** depending on what you need:

- **£500-£800** - Template-based website with essential features
- **£1,500-£2,500** - Semi-custom design with booking integration
- **£3,000-£5,000+** - Fully custom design with advanced features

But here's what nobody tells you: **the upfront cost is only part of the story.**

## What Actually Affects the Cost?

### 1. Design Complexity

A basic 5-page brochure site (Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact) is straightforward. Add custom animations, unique layouts for each service, or interactive before/after sliders? That's more design time = higher cost.

**Budget option:** Clean, professional template adapted to your brand  
**Premium option:** Completely custom design matching your salon's exact vibe

### 2. Features & Functionality

This is where costs jump significantly:

**Essential features (usually included):**
- Mobile-responsive design
- Contact form
- Service list with descriptions
- Image gallery
- Google Maps integration
- Basic SEO setup

**Premium features (add cost):**
- Online booking system integration (Fresha, Phorest, etc.)
- Gift voucher sales
- Membership area for loyalty schemes
- Blog for content marketing
- Multi-location support
- Advanced SEO with local targeting

### 3. Content Creation

Do you have professional photos? Service descriptions written? Or does the designer need to write copy, source images, and create everything from scratch?

**Your content ready:** Lower cost  
**Designer creates content:** Add £300-£800

### 4. Ongoing Costs

This catches people out. Your website has running costs:

- **Hosting:** £5-£25/month
- **Domain name:** £10-£15/year
- **SSL certificate:** Usually free (Let's Encrypt)
- **Maintenance:** £0-£100/month depending on support level
- **Booking system fees:** £20-£50/month if integrated

## Real Example: Rebecca Rennolds Permanent Beauty & Laser

Rebecca came to me with a dated website that wasn't getting her bookings. She needed something that looked as professional as her clinic.

We built a semi-custom WordPress site with:
- Clean, modern design showcasing her treatments
- Mobile-optimized gallery (most of her traffic is mobile)
- Detailed service pages with pricing
- Contact form with proper lead capture
- Local SEO for "permanent beauty Yorkshire"

**Total cost:** £1,200 + first year hosting  
**Result:** Within 3 months, she was getting 40% more enquiries through the website.

Here's what Rebecca said:

> "Steve is fantastic! He created a beautiful website for my skin clinic. The finished result looks extremely professional, slick and stylish. Steve couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful."

The website wasn't just prettier - it actually worked harder for her business.

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

### 1. Your Time

Even with a professional designer, you need to:
- Provide feedback on designs (2-4 hours)
- Supply photos and content (4-6 hours if you're writing it)
- Test the booking system (1-2 hours)
- Review and approve before launch (1-2 hours)

Budget at least 10 hours of your time across the project.

### 2. Photography

Stock photos look cheap. You know it, your clients know it. Professional salon photography costs £200-£500 but makes a massive difference.

Alternatively, take your own photos with a decent smartphone - just make sure they're well-lit and show your space at its best.

### 3. Ongoing Updates

Your website isn't "set and forget." You'll want to:
- Update seasonal offers
- Add new treatments
- Refresh photos periodically
- Keep WordPress and plugins updated (security)

Either budget time to do this yourself (free but time-consuming) or pay £50-£100/month for a support package.

## DIY vs Professional: The Real Cost

"I'll just build it myself on Wix/Squarespace" is tempting. Let's be honest about what that actually costs:

**Monetary cost:**
- Wix/Squarespace: £15-£25/month = £180-£300/year
- Professional photos: £250
- Stock images: £50-£100/year
- Time learning the platform: 20-30 hours
- Time building the site: 15-20 hours
- Time maintaining it: 2-3 hours/month

**Hidden cost:**
- DIY sites often look DIY (hurts your brand)
- Limited SEO capability (fewer bookings)
- Technical issues you can't fix (frustration)
- Time you could spend on clients (lost revenue)

If you value your time at even £30/hour, you've just spent £1,500+ of your time to save £800 on a designer. And the result usually isn't as good.

## What Should You Actually Pay?

Here's my honest recommendation based on where you are:

**Just starting out or on a tight budget:** £500-£800 template-based site. Get online professionally, start building your presence, upgrade later when revenue allows.

**Established salon (1-3 years trading):** £1,500-£2,500 semi-custom. You need something that reflects your quality and integrates with your booking system properly.

**Luxury salon or multiple locations:** £3,000+ custom build. Your website is a significant revenue driver - invest accordingly.

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Too cheap (under £400):**
- Probably offshore outsourcing
- Template slapped together in an hour
- No ongoing support
- Hidden costs will emerge

**Too expensive (£8,000+ for a simple brochure site):**
- Overpriced for what you need
- Agency overhead vs actual value
- Features you won't use

**No hosting/domain included:**
- Extra £200-£400/year surprise
- Potential vendor lock-in
- Hidden renewal fees

## Questions to Ask Before You Commit

1. **What's included in the price?** (Get it in writing)
2. **Who owns the website?** (You should own it, not the designer)
3. **What about ongoing costs?** (Hosting, maintenance, updates)
4. **How long until I'm live?** (Timeline matters for business planning)
5. **What happens if I need changes later?** (Support terms and costs)
6. **Can I update content myself?** (WordPress yes, custom-coded maybe not)
7. **What about SEO?** (Basic setup included? Or extra cost?)

## The Bottom Line

A beauty salon website costs what you need it to cost. You can absolutely get online professionally for £500-£800 if that's your budget right now. You can also invest £3,000+ if you want something truly bespoke.

What matters is:
- **It looks professional** (builds trust)
- **It works on mobile** (most of your traffic)
- **People can contact/book easily** (converts visitors to clients)
- **You can afford the ongoing costs** (hosting, maintenance)
- **It represents your brand properly** (quality matters)

The worst option is no website at all. The second worst is a DIY disaster that makes your salon look amateur.
