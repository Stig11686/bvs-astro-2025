There were two audiences that Rob and Aaron wanted to reach - firstly, private clients who may be  looking to get a new  features fitted in their home. Secondly, industry professionals such as Architects, Surveyors and the like, who may need to check out previous work done by them before awarding them a  contract.

We needed a way to display their work in enough detail to catch the eye, but with crisp clarity too  - it was clear that imagery was going to be key here.

Luckily there were a lot of images to work with - and using case studies and examples of previous work would be paramount.

Rob and Aaron wanted to stick with their theme of neutral colours and greys - which work really well with web content. In addition it was key that the logo was prominent and stood out as their major branding was all done through this.

I decided to keep the hero text to the side, to let  the images of the wonderful work do the talking. The main calls to action are to either see more of the work, or to book in for a consultation. 

### Challenge & Solution

Rob and Aaron had used WordPress to design their previous site, so as they were comfortable with using it, there was no need to change that. I did simplify it for them though, so that they didn't have to do any design - all they needed to do was input their content and it would generate the content into the layout that I set. Essentially I created a custom theme for them.

I gave them the ability to add projects, and add custom data to their projects - for example, each project can add a picture, with multiple other pictures added to it to create a gallery. This allows them to show off different types of kitchen, or staircase, or any other type of job they choose,.

They can do the same with other content types, such as testimonials,   case studies and products. The next stage us to be able to sell their products on their website.

#### Final Result

The site successfully launched it's v1 at the back end of 2024, with additional eCommerce functionality launched in mid-2025. The custom development of their store with custom product options was an exciting addition to their website
