Rebecca Rennolds Permanent Beauty & Laser is a high-end beauty salon offering specialist laser and beauty treatments. Their online presence needed to reflect their premium services while making it easy for customers to book appointments and find information.

### Challenge & Solution

Rebecca had a business that was expanding, and going into a new high street premises. She  needed a website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and mobile-friendly, with a clear focus on customer conversion.                                            

#### Challenges Identified:

- No current website meant everything was done via social media - too many channels to manage, and  to update. 
- Lack of clear booking options led to drop-offs. 
- SEO issues prevented high-ranking search results for key beauty services

#### How We Solved It:

- Conducted competitor analysis to identify industry best practices
- Created a customer journey map to optimize navigation and conversions
- Developed a content strategy focusing on services, FAQs, and clear calls to action
- Made use of existing positive reviews to create brand trust

Becca already had a colour pallete and logo  for me to work from - it's amazing how much can come together just from those things. By mixing in her pinks and golds with subtle greys, I came up with a  clean, clear layout.

The  two most important things for Becca were that here clients could book easily, and that her clients could see her price list. Both of these are available in the top level navigation,  so her clients could find them straight away.  As this is a beauty business,   imagery was going to be key - so there are plenty of ways to access galleries of her work.

Using WordPress as a framework, I created Becca multiple custom pages. I used the Picostrap theme and LiveCanvas visual editor for this, using Bootstrap components to piece the site together. Once I had an idea of where the content was going, I  could add  visual touches,  such as the subtle, light grey signature font above some of the headings.

Adding a radius to the corners of the image galleries really helped  add visual interest to the site.

There  was an option for Becca to have her treatments stored in the WordPress database to automatically generate a page for each treatment, however, during the design process Becca decided she didn't want that at this time. This option is open for her in the future though, in case she ever wants  to revisit it.

### Final Result

Becca was really happy with her site, as she has reminded me on multiple follow up visits, and I am currently working on another business for her. Many clients have come to me since  saying 'I like the work you did on Rebecca Rennolds website...' which is a testament to it standing the test of time.

In terms of cold hard analytics, Beccas  site ranks strongly locally,  thanks  to a combination of good targeted content, and the work Becca does to get verified, trustworthy google reviews. The site gets between  3 and 4000 page views per month and that is growing  at a strong rate.

Any website is a team effort between  the designer and the  business - this is living proof of that, and a piece of work I'm really proud of.
