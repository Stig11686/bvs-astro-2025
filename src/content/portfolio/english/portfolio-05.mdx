## The Client

Rebecca Rennolds Permanent Beauty & Laser is a high-end beauty clinic in Yorkshire, specialising in permanent makeup, laser treatments, and advanced aesthetics. With a growing reputation for quality work, Rebecca was ready to expand into new high street premises — and needed a website that matched her premium positioning.

---

## The Problem

Rebecca's business was thriving, but her online presence wasn't keeping pace:

- **No website at all** — everything was managed through social media, which was becoming overwhelming
- **Scattered online presence** — multiple social channels to update, no central hub for information
- **Lost bookings** — potential clients couldn't easily find treatment info or book appointments
- **Invisible on Google** — no SEO presence meant she was missing local search traffic
- **Price list buried** — clients had to DM to ask about prices, creating friction

For a premium beauty business, this wasn't sustainable. Rebecca needed a professional website that worked as hard as she did.

---

## The Solution

I built Rebecca a custom WordPress website designed around two core goals: **easy booking** and **clear pricing**.

### What We Built:

- **Booking and price list in main navigation** — the two things clients want most, accessible in one click
- **Premium visual design** — pinks, golds, and subtle greys matching her existing branding
- **Gallery-focused layout** — multiple ways to browse her work, because in beauty, seeing is believing
- **Mobile-first approach** — most of her clients browse on phones
- **Local SEO foundations** — targeting "permanent makeup Yorkshire" and related searches
- **Easy-to-update CMS** — Rebecca can add new gallery images and update prices herself

### Technical Details:

- Built on WordPress with Picostrap theme and LiveCanvas visual editor
- Custom Bootstrap components for a unique, non-template look
- Signature font styling for brand consistency
- Rounded image galleries for visual softness
- Future-proofed: option to auto-generate individual treatment pages when ready

## The Results

This website has stood the test of time — and the numbers prove it:

- **3,000 - 4,000 page views per month** (and growing)
- **Strong local search rankings** for beauty services in Yorkshire
- **Clear booking pathway** reducing enquiry friction
- **Client referrals** — multiple new clients have said "I found you through your website"
- **Repeat business** — I'm now building a second website for Rebecca

### The Real Proof?

Years after launch, clients still come to me saying: *"I like the work you did on Rebecca Rennolds' website — can you do something similar for me?"*

That's the best testimonial a website can get.

## Key Takeaway

For beauty businesses, your website needs to do three things brilliantly:

1. **Show the work** — galleries that prove your skill
2. **Make booking effortless** — one click to book or enquire  
3. **Display pricing clearly** — don't make clients hunt for it

Get those right, and the website becomes your best salesperson — working 24/7 while you focus on clients.
