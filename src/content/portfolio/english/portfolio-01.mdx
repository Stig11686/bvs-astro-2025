When Ilkley Dental Care approached me for a new website - the first thing I did was quietly open their old one. I thought 'hey, this looks good! What could I do here!'  But this was a site that needed more inspection. The information was difficult to find, when the site needed updating it was hard for the staff to do, and the developer in charge was not particularly responsive.

My biggest challenge though, was website lethargy from the team. Because their site had let them down in the past, they didn't really see the point in having one, or the importance of  it to their business.  I  was hoping I could convince them...

### Challenge & Solution [.text-h3]

There was a tight timescale on this project, so I started off with a basic design based around the information architecture. The information on the current site was not easy to get to. There was no menu to view until you scrolled down the page, which led to confusion. The text was written in large blocks, making it difficult to read, and it wasn't easy to know what to do next.

To book an appointment, it took you to  a contact form, which you had to fill in, and the only feedback you got was that a message had been sent. Not ideal! The telephone number wasn't displayed prominently, and there was no obvious Call to Action which let you speak directly to a person - not ideal for a dentist.

I then looked to simplify the information architecture - a simple menu at the top of the page, visible straight away, to go to information you may want to see. Everything else was hidden away in the footer, available for consumption when required.

One of the biggest pain points was reviews. They were being collected and input manually, and then collected again on Google for SEO. I streamlined this process, so that all reviews collected on the website would be google reviews, and displayed in a widget on the homepage. No more duplication of effort and no more manual input!! Yay!

I also created a blog, and over the coming weeks will be training the team on the most meaningful way to write these - increasing the impact the business will have on the local community, reputation, and therefore, trade.

## Final Result [.text-h3]

I am really pleased with the modern, clean cut design of this website, but also the fact that the information architecture  is much improved, making Ilkley Dental Care's website a much easier, faster and useful to nagivate. With upcoming content improvements, The website has already started providing more leads for the business, and easier ways to interact with their clients. What a win!
