In construction, your reputation is everything. A professional website showcases your best work, builds credibility with potential clients, and helps you win better contracts. At BVS Web Design, we build websites for builders, contractors, and construction companies across Yorkshire.

## Why Construction Companies Need Professional Websites

Gone are the days when word-of-mouth alone filled your order book. Today's clients – homeowners, developers, and commercial buyers – research online before making contact. A professional construction website:

- **Builds instant credibility** with potential clients and partners
- **Showcases completed projects** with professional photography
- **Generates qualified leads** through your quote request forms
- **Demonstrates expertise** in your specialist areas
- **Improves tender success** – assessors check your online presence

## What Makes a Great Construction Website?

After building websites for construction and trades businesses, we know what converts visitors into enquiries:

- **Professional photography** – Quality images of completed projects
- **Clear service descriptions** – What you do, where you work, project sizes
- **Credibility signals** – Accreditations, insurance, memberships, awards
- **Case studies** – Before/after transformations with client testimonials
- **Easy contact** – Multiple ways to get in touch, including mobile click-to-call
- **Fast and mobile-friendly** – Site managers browse on phones

## Our Construction Website Work

We've helped construction and interior design businesses create professional online presences:

### Antler Interiors

Antler Interiors specialises in high-end residential and commercial interior projects. They needed a website that showcased their exceptional craftsmanship and design expertise to attract premium clients.

**The Challenge:** A dated website that didn't reflect the quality of their work or appeal to their target market of discerning homeowners and commercial clients.

**The Solution:** A sophisticated, portfolio-focused website with detailed project case studies, before/after galleries, and clear service descriptions.

**The Result:** A professional online presence that positions Antler Interiors as the premium choice for interior construction and fit-out projects.
