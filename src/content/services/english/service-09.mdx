Stop paying excessive commission to booking.com and Expedia. A professional hotel website drives direct bookings, builds your brand, and puts you in control of the guest relationship from first click to checkout.

## Why Hotels Need Direct Booking Websites

Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) charge 15-25% commission on every booking. For a hotel doing £200,000 in annual revenue through OTAs, that's **£30,000-£50,000** going to middlemen.

A well-designed hotel website with a direct booking engine pays for itself many times over:

- **Reduce OTA dependency** and keep more revenue
- **Own the guest relationship** from first contact
- **Build your brand** rather than the OTA's
- **Upsell directly** – room upgrades, dinner packages, experiences
- **Capture email addresses** for repeat marketing

## What Makes a Great Hotel Website?

After working with hotels, B&Bs, and guest houses across Yorkshire, we know what converts browsers into bookers:

- **Stunning imagery** – Professional photos of rooms, grounds, and local attractions
- **Clear availability** – Real-time room availability and pricing
- **Mobile booking** – 60%+ of hotel searches happen on mobile
- **Trust signals** – Reviews, awards, and accreditations prominently displayed
- **Local information** – Help guests plan their stay with area guides
- **Speed** – Fast loading even with image-heavy galleries

## Our Hotel Website Work

We've helped Yorkshire accommodation businesses create online presences that drive direct bookings:

### The Yorkshire Unicorn
A distinctive venue offering accommodation alongside their restaurant needed a website that showcased both seamlessly. We created an integrated solution that drives bookings for rooms and tables.
