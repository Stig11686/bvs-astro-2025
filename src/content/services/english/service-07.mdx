## Professional Websites for Dental Practices

Your dental practice deserves a website that looks as professional as your surgery. I design modern, mobile-friendly websites for dentists that build patient trust and make booking appointments effortless.

Whether you're a family practice, cosmetic specialist, or multi-site group — I'll create a website that works as hard as you do.

## The Problem With Most Dental Websites

Let's be honest: most dental practice websites were built years ago and it shows.

**Common problems I see:**

- ❌ Outdated design that doesn't reflect your modern surgery
- ❌ Not mobile-friendly (over 60% of patients search on phones)
- ❌ Phone number buried or impossible to find
- ❌ No online booking option
- ❌ Slow loading times driving patients to competitors
- ❌ Poor Google visibility for local searches
- ❌ Generic templates that look like every other dentist

Your website is often a patient's first impression. If it looks dated, they'll assume your practice is too.
